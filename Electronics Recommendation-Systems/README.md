Data Description:
Amazon Reviews data ( data source ) The repository has several
datasets. For this case study, we are using the Electronics
dataset.

Domain:
E-commerce

Context:
Online E-commerce websites like Amazon, Flipkart uses
different recommendation models to provide different
suggestions to different users. Amazon currently uses
item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive
data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in
real-time.

Attribute Information:
● userId : Every user identified with a unique id
● productId : Every product identified with a unique id
● Rating : Rating of the corresponding product by
the corresponding user
● timestamp : Time of the rating ( ignore this column
for this exercise)

Learning Outcomes:
● Exploratory Data Analysis
● Creating a Recommendation system using real data
● Collaborative filtering

Objective:
Build a recommendation system to recommend products to
customers based on the their previous ratings for other
products.

Steps and tasks:
1. Read and explore the given dataset. (Rename
column/add headers, plot histograms, find data
characteristics) 
2. Take a subset of the dataset to make it less sparse/ denser.
( For example, keep the users only who has given 50 or
more number of ratings ) 
3. Split the data randomly into train and test dataset. ( For
example, split it in 70/30 ratio) 
4. Build Popularity Recommender model. 
5. Build Collaborative Filtering model. 
6. Evaluate both the models. ( Once the model is trained on
the training data, it can be used to compute the error
(RMSE) on predictions made on the test data.) 
7. Get top - K ( K = 5) recommendations. Since our goal is to
recommend new products for each user based on his/her
habits, we will recommend 5 new products. 
8. Summarise your insights.
